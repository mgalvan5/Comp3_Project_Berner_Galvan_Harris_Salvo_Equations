# Comp3_Project_Berner_Galvan_Harris_Salvo_Equations
Final Project for Computational Methods 3 course at Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) under the tutelage of LTC Matthew Smith. This project develops an application to explore Hughes Salvo Equations via battle simulations. 

## Overall Project Objective

## Setup Prerequisites 
1. Ensure you have an NPS Hamming High Performance Computing (HPC) account with username and password.
2. To run this you must either be on the NPS network or GlobalConnect VPN.
3. f

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Reach out to any of the authors of this github repo (Captains John Berner, Michael Galvan, and/or Ryan Harris, USMC) or your friendly neighborhood Comp 3 professor. Our nps emails will likely have evaporated by now but you can find us on the USMC locator (ask a Marine to help you). 

## Potential future additions
This methodology should provide a solid framework for if you wish to make a tool that works for other salvo equations or Lanchester-based equations. There will likely need to be some tweaking to the code and the simulation process (changing simultaenous salvos to perhaps sequential for example) but your Comp 3 class should equip you with the skills to do so. There's also always trusty Captain ChatGPT to lend a hand. 

## Contributing
If you do create a new workflow that explores another salvo equation, please feel free to reach out to us and we'd love to update this page with that addition. 

## Acknowledgment
A special thank you to LTC Smith for teaching us some very challenging and new material in a comprehensive and structured way. We owe a lot of future success to the foundations you built for us. Thank you sir!

## License
MIT License: AKA very permissive. But just enough protection so we aren't liable for any real-world force allocation decisions you may or may not base upon this work. 

## Project status
Currently it runs for the four models we simulated (Basic, Basic Stochastic, Modified, Modified Stochastic) and we don't look to add any more ourselves at this time but are open to additons from other users who feel so inclined.
